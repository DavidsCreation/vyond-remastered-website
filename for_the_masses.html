    <h1>For the masses:</h1>
    <p>My friends, colleges, all the people I have known.</p>
    <p>I send you a simple message about this project, digestible, and as respecting as possible.</p>
    <p>It is crucial that we, as a group of people, a group of all people's around the world, understand the opinions that the masses represent, and the options that they give us.</p>
    <p>If this goes against the corporate ruling over the western world, then that is a good thing.</p>
    <p>The Vyond Remastered owner encourages you to send urgent humanitarian aid to Palestine, to avoid buying from zionist entities, and to stop supporting the colonial rule of Palestine by Israeli aggressors, and Northern Ireland by British aggressors.</p>
    <p>Anyone who supports Israel, step away from our project at once, we will not welcome you.</p>
    <p>We represent the people around the world, and the people, not the <b>demons</b>, will always be willing to fight against oppression.</p>
    <p>The Vyond Remastered project will always listen to the masses and will in return, build an objectively better project than the opposition, as we maintain the open source, pro modification, anti closed source, future proof stance that will remain for years, if not, decades.</p>
    <p>There will be a time when we tell our children, the thing we have created.</p>
    <p>And they will understand, no matter the position they be in, how the people of on community can unite under the banner of a common goal;</p>
    <p>A truly free video maker.</p>
