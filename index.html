    <h1>Introduction to Vyond Remastered:</h1>
    <p>Vyond Remastered is a Legacy Video Maker clone with the goal of making the video maker open source, accessible, and <b>nostalgic.</b></p>
    <p>We've been going around for years now, back when I started this project, I was just a regular ol' Windows nerd who knew nothing about privacy.</p>
    <p>But since then, my path has changed, and one of the main features of Vyond Remastered is now privacy.</p>
    <p>Supporting all operating systems has been one of our biggest priorities, which is why one of our developers is specifically working on MacOS support.</p>
    <p>As of writing, I'm currently using Arch Linux with <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=gOGM0uHCDFk">Hyprland</a>, which has been complicated, but brilliant after configuration, and Vyond Remastered works perfectly with it.</p>
    <p>Me and Joseph have been working in collaboration together in recent times, and as such, we have been able to create a beautiful project that has been the forefront to Linux useablitiy and customisability.</p>
    <p>We were and still are, willing to provide a legacy experience to the users, while also trying not to bloat up the user experience.</p>
    <p>In such a process, we were able to add some, and deny some, features.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Ok, so, what ARE these features?</h1>
    <p>I'm glad you asked, my friend.</p>
    <p>We added the legacy importer, on request of the masses. Which the biggest competitor of our time, Wrapper: Offline, outright refused to add.</p>
    <p>We agreed to take on the challenge of adding the real Community Library, and got most of the job done thanks to my favourite boy, Joseph.</p>
    <p>We agreed to add a video resolution option in the name of nostaligia and pride for what once was.</p>
    <p>We agreed to take on hardships that other LVMs refuse to add because they are "too hard", or "useless", because, we actually love the community, which is why we're adding what THEY want.</p>
    <p>We refused the exporter bloatware, on request of the acknowledged.</p>
    <p>We refused to add unstable features, like video importing.</p>
    <p>And most of all, we decided to <b>listen</b>, to people just like you, unlike the mainstream of LVM projects, unlike FlashThemes, especially, the project guilty of being CLOSED source, and refusing to listen to the community, despite clearly using wrapper, as seen in some screenshots.</p>
    <p>FlashThemes technically breaks the MIT license of whatever wrapper clone it's using, since the major two; Wrapper Offline, and GoAnimate Wrapper, use the MIT license.</p>
    <p>This should mean that FlashThemes should be considered even more of a legal gray area than wrapper offline and, admittedly, vyond remastered.</p>
