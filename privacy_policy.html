    <h1>Vyond Remastered's Privacy Policy: 2 Sections</h1>
    <hr>
    <h1>Section one: this website</h1>
    <p>I hate corporate junk talk, so I will make this fairly short;</p>
    <p>This website does not track you at all. We own our domain through privacy respecting providers, and no tracking requests are being sent through this here page.</p>
    <p></p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Section two: Vyond Remastered</h1>
    <p>Vyond Remastered does not track you in any way, and we never will.</p>
    <p>We use cookies for one purpose and one purpose only, saving preferences.</p>
    <p>This data is not sent to the Vyond Remastered Team, owner, or server.</p>
    <p>Vyond Remastered does however, use Ungoogled Chromium.</p>
    <p>This is only because we physically <b>HAVE TO</b> use Chromium right now, and if we ever get the option to use a hardened version of Firefox, for example, we would.</p>
    <p>I personally recommend anyone who would know how to do this and have flash working direct message me, because I hate using Ungoogled Chromium for anything, and will avoid it whenever possible.</p>
    <p>You will always have the right to express any privacy concerns you have with the Vyond Remastered team, and if you would like to express those concerns, then you can.</p>
    <p>If so, please join the Revolt server linked below, and express your concerns, after doing this, you also have the right to have your messages deleted from the server, and to be forgotten.</p>
    <p>The vyond remastered owner loves the project, and will never corporatise, put tracking in, or make anything paid.</p>
    <p>We are willing to go by whatever international rights a person has, but we refuse to send any data from our Revolt server to any government industries.</p>
    <p>This means that we will not and feel no need to, send messages, tech support information, or anything to do with our project, to governments, if they don't like that, they can just deal with it.</p>
